# @rbxts/basic-utilities
A Roblox-TS package of basic utilities I use all the time and just want to share easily between my projects - open source because maybe someone else doesn't want to reinvent the wheel, too.

# CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME
Please. This is a very general package. If you've got something to share, just share it here :)

# Utilities List
 - Lazy&lt;T&gt; \
 A simple lazy loader for a value of type T
 - StrictMap&lt;K, V&gt; \
 A simple map wrapper that throws when trying to get a value that is not set. \
 Useful for times when a missing value should throw an error anyway and you don't feel like writing those three lines of code yourself. \
 Implements the accompanying ReadonlyStrictMap interface.
